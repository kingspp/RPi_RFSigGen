RPi RF Signal Generator

The RPi RFSigGen software implements the functionality of
a simple RF Signal Generator by using a Raspberry Pi and a Direct
Digital Synthesiser (DDS) module. The Raspberry Pi’s General Purpose
Input Output (GPIO) interface is programmed to control the DDS module
and therefore generate the RF signal. The Graphical User Interface
(GUI) allows the user to set the operating frequency and to turn the
DDS module on and off.
